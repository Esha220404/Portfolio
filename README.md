Project implementation 


A. Build a personal Portfolio

As part of my internship experience, I designed and developed a personal portfolio website aimed at showcasing my technical skills, completed projects, and contact information in a visually engaging and professional format.

The site includes distinct sections such as About, Projects, and Contact, each carefully structured for clarity and accessibility. I implemented a responsive layout using modern HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to ensure the site delivers a consistent user experience across all devices and screen sizes.

This project not only helped me refine my front-end development skills but also gave me practical experience in presenting my work to potential employers or clients.
