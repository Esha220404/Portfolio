Project implementation 


A. Build a personal Portfolio

During my internship, I focused on developing three key web projects to strengthen my front-end development skills. I created a fully responsive personal portfolio website to professionally showcase my skills and projects, incorporating sections like About, Projects, and Contact.

B. To-do list or note taking app with local storage

I also built a to-do list app with localStorage integration, ensuring task data persisted across sessions. 


C. A product listing page with filtering and sorting option


Additionally, I developed a dynamic product listing page featuring category-based filtering and sorting by price and rating. These projects improved my proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive design while deepening my understanding of user experience and data handling in web applications.
